# Stocker üìâüëÅÔ∏èüìà
A Python-based stock portfolio evaluator that combines financial analysis, sentiment analysis, and a large language model (chatGPT) to provide actionable insights for investors. Developed by Gunnar Balch, Stocker integrates APIs such as OpenAI's chatGPT API, NewsAPI, and YFinance to fetch relevant data, analyze metrics, and generate detailed stock evaluation reports.

### Features
- **Interface**:
    - Users use Stocker through console commandline arguments. A web-interface will be implemented in the future.
        - Users can store portfolio csv files in the /porfolios directory. Stocker will scan csv files in /porfolios if users DON'T provide a portfolio via commandline inputs.
- **LLM-Driven Analysis**:
    - Leverages OpenAI's GPT API for detailed analysis and reporting.
- **Sentiment Analysis**:
    - NewsAPI aggregates recent and relevant articles pertaining to each stock's sentiment. A 'Sentiment Score' is assessed to each stock based on the overall sentiment expressed from all the articles. Both TextBlob and chatGPT are used to grade sentiment. Scores get saved as a csv file.
        - TextBlob's sentiment score is used as a baseline to compare with chatGPT's sentiment score.
        - ChatGPT analyzes a stock's articles as a whole, providing a paragraph synopsis explaining general sentiment, it then provides a sentiment score.
        - Sentiment Scores for both TextBlob and ChatGPT can range from -5(very negative sentiment) to +5(very positive sentiment).
- **Financial Metrics Analysis**:
    - YFinance aggregates necessary metrics for each stock. ChatGPT analyzes calculated variables and returns analysis on the metrics: providing a synopsis and a relevant score. The analysis and scores get saved as a csv file.
        - Current version only provides *Risk Analysis* for each Stock.
            - Beta, Volatility, and Sharpe Ratio are calculated and then analyzed.
            - ChatGPT's analysis provides a discussion over the implications of each metric and assesses a 'Risk Score'.
          
### Dependencies
To run properly you must provide api keys for chatGPT and NewsAPI
```bash
pip install openai
pip install newsapi-python
pip install textblob
pip install yfinance --upgrade --no-cache-dir 
```
- yfinance seeks to limit queries with every update, making older versions redundant. 
- Using the pip install above removes redundant versions and installs working ones.
- I may migrate from yfinance to another alternative like Alpha Vantage, Tiingo, or Bloomberg.
- Be aware, using 'openai migrate' may cause issues depending on your OS. 
It's recommended to use ' grit apply openai ' for migrating the code effectively.


### How to Run
Either simply run setup.py and provide api keys when prompted or run setup.py with the keys as command-line arguments.
- Example:
  ```bash
  python setup.py
  ```
  OR
  ```bash
  python setup.py <chatGPT API key> <NewsAPI key>
  ```
### Future Developments
- **Enhanced Metrics**: Incorporate additional useful financial metrics (e.g. P/E, Dividen Yield )
- **Performance**: Measure Stocker's accuracy and usability by using old data to see if it can accurately predict a stock's performance. Perhaps create a brokerage account that uses Stocker to create a profitable portfolio.
